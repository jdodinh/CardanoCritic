<p> We introduce our goofy movie critic. He’s sure that due to the fact that he’s been working as a critic for decades, it means that he can come up with a perfect recipe for a successful movie. Since he’s top commentator on IMDb and he spends whole nights browsing and memorising details about yugoslavian vampire movies (image needed), he decides to base his decisions on the ranking similar to the one used by IMDb. </p>

Thus he decides to check if CANADA is among the countries with high rated movies. Since last year when he wanted to change his job he participated in a summer data science bootcamp, he knows how to present the results he needs:</p>
<p>Due to his German origin, he wants be sure in advance in which month the movie must </p>
