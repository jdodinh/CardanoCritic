<div style="text-align: left"><p>Movies are an inseparable part of our lives. They are a form of art, loved and consumed by many. The movie industry is very competitive, as the number of movies produced per year grows exponentially, so there is a need to maximise chances of producing successful movies. However, little is known about what people's interests are, as well as how they have changed over time. By utilising the CMU dataset, enhanced by an IMDb rating dataset, the goal is to delve into the key ingredients that form a successful movie. The motivation is to find out which aspects influence a movieâ€™s success as well as the evolution of the corresponding factors in various geographical regions and over different time periods. The results could provide support to movie producers as they will capture the essence of what people desire in a movie.</p></div>
